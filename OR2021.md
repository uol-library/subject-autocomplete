<p>The Ideas Challenge is a long-running Open Repositories tradition, where teams form during the conference to come up with great ideas to solve repository challenges or lead the way toward new innovations. In the past, teams have had just the 3 days of the conference to formulate their idea and pitch it to the audience and judges during the closing session. Last year, we changed up the format and kicked-off a year-long ideas challenge, with the goal of allowing teams to not just come up with an idea, but actually take steps to implement it. We&#8217;ll share some results from 2020 during this session and introduce the 2021 ideas challenge, which will be another year-long event. Those interested in the Ideas Challenge should join the&nbsp;<a href="https://or2020ideaschallenge.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-fv3t3vnn-iHewkmre2VjeJV02zlUbbw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ideas Challenge Slack channel</a>&nbsp;.</p>

<p><strong>Panel: Speaking up and speaking out &#8211; who will shape the narrative for OA repositories?</strong><br><em>Shearer, Kathleen (1); Rodrigues, Eloy (1,2)</em><br><em>1: COAR, International; 2: University of Minho</em><br>In the last several months, there have been a number of misleading statements about open access repositories made by several publisher groups. These statements and blog posts seem to be part of a coordinated strategy to diminish the role of OA repositories in favour of the gold (and for many publishers) APC route for policy compliance. The aim is to create a narrative that gold open access is the only “legitimate” route for OA, and inculcate these misconceptions within the research community. COAR contends that the repository community should be following these events closely, and work together with other stakeholder communities &#8211; researchers, universities and funders &#8211; to define and elevate our own narrative, which associates repositories with the values of inclusion, diversity, trust, and innovation. This interactive panel will bring together panelists from the university, funder, and repository community to discuss how we can work together as a community to counteract this publisher narrative and be more proactive in defining the role and value of repositories in the future of scholarly communications and open science.</p>

<p><strong>The Carolina Digital Repository During COVID-19: Responding to a Pandemic</strong><br><em>Kati, Rebekah</em><br><em>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, United States of America</em><br>The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified conversations about widespread open access to scholarly literature. Institutional repositories such as the Carolina Digital Repository (CDR) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) can play a key part in the dissemination of scholarly research. Access to coronavirus research was particularly important for the CDR, as UNC-CH is one of the leading institutions in the world for coronavirus research. The pandemic also had local impacts to our work. In March 2020, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) moved to online learning in response to rising coronavirus cases. Due to this change, many UNC-CH Libraries staff members and student workers needed work that could be done remotely. In this presentation, I will describe several projects which we undertook this year to increase access and dissemination of research, and to provide UNC Libraries staff with work which could be completed remotely and asynchronously. For each project, I will share the team’s successes, failures, lessons learned and plans for the future. I will also describe enhancements the team made to our Hyrax-based repository to facilitate the success of these projects.</p>
<p><strong>CTDA in Context</strong><br><em>Colati, Greg (1); Kemezis, Michael (1); Hinkson-Grant, Kayla (2)</em><br><em>1: University of Connecticut, United States of America; 2: Mt. Holyoke College</em><br>CTDA In Context (https://ctdaincontext.org) is a program designed to foster diversity, equity, and inclusion in the preserved historical record of Connecticut through the collections of the Connecticut Digital Archive. There is a growing misconception that if a community or population cannot be found in digital form then collections about that community must not exist. Researchers, especially lifelong learners and K12 students, assume that all relevant information exists online. Since the CTDA does not own any collections itself and can only offer content contributed by its member institutions we are constrained by the collecting policies and interests of our membership. CTDA in Context addresses this issue through three interrelated objectives that uses the CTDA’s position as a statewide organization to affect the content of the collections we steward and the diversity of the digital historical record in Connecticut: Diversify the CTDA community to include memory organizations dedicated to documenting the activities of currently underrepresented groups and topics; Educate current content managers about new descriptive and collection management practices; Help members identify new collections, previously digitized, born digital, and/or physical, among their local communities to add to the CTDA to enrich the overall content in the repository.</p>
<p><strong>Connected in Science: How arXiv facilitates global interactions during the pandemic and beyond</strong><br><em>Presani, Eleonora</em><br><em>arXiv, United States of America</em><br>In early 2020, the mutual impact of COVID-19 and OA repositories like arXiv on each other was unknown. Soon, we realized that the pace of submissions to arXiv were not just holding steady – they were increasing. This presented multiple challenges. First, a wide range of readers would now be seeking COVID papers on arXiv. Second, acceptance of papers to arXiv relies on a network of 190 moderators, and arXiv did not have moderators with expertise in coronaviruses. Third, the pandemic’s uncertainty prompted arXiv to consider how to maintain services if a high proportion of moderators or staff were unable to work. Fourth, although arXiv moderators had always worked remotely across the globe, the moderation tools revealed serious limitations. In this presentation, arXiv’s executive director, Eleonora Presani, will share the solutions &#8212; technical and otherwise – to these challenges, including the development of a new interface for moderator engagement. The ways in which arXiv met these challenges provide a model for moving forward beyond the pandemic.</p>

<p><strong>Fedora Software and Community Update: All Aboard for Fedora 6.0</strong><br><em>Wilcox, David; Griffith, Arran</em><br><em>LYRASIS, Canada</em><br>For the past several years, the Fedora community has prioritized alignment with linked data best practices and modern web standards which guided our previous development efforts. But through extensive community feedback and engagement we have shifted our efforts in new directions. The design and development of Fedora 6.0 has been guided by three principles: improve the digital preservation feature set, support migrations from all previous versions of the software, and improve performance and scale. This presentation will provide an overview of Fedora 6.0 and an update on the current state of development, highlighting areas of interest such as the migration utilities and documentation created to support users in the transition from past versions to 6.0 as well as the robust testing measures implemented allowing users direct access to crucial performance metrics. Finally presenters will explain the post-production focus on adoption, support and elevated community engagement.</p>
<p><strong>DSpace 7.0 : Coming to a DSpace near you</strong><br><em>Donohue, Tim</em><br><em>LYRASIS, United States of America</em><br>It’s been a long time coming and we’re glad to say 7.0 is finally here! This talk helps your organization prepare for the next evolution of DSpace platform: DSpace 7.0. What does it look like? How would I upgrade (or install it)? How easy is it to brand/theme? Why did this take so long (and how did we adapt, despite a pandemic)? While retaining its ease-of-use, out-of-the-box goals, DSpace 7 introduces many major new features to existing users and the repository community in general. This talk will provide an overview of each. Major new features include: * A brand new, client-side, responsive user interface (built on Angular), with drag-and-drop submission process and improved usability. Theme it with just knowledge of CSS (Bootstrap) and HTML. * A brand new, full-featured, self-describing REST API, which opens your DSpace data to advanced third-party integrations / tools. * A powerful new Configurable Entities object model (i.e. typed Items with relationships between them), allowing for advanced integrations with external identifier systems (e.g. ORCID), current research information systems (CRIS), journal publishing systems, etc. * Enhanced GDPR support, OpenAIREv4 support, and (coming in 7.2) alignment with COAR Next Generation Repositories recommendations (ResourceSync and Signposting).</p>
<p><strong>Islandora Community Update: Islandora at Home</strong><br><em>Lamb, Danny (1); Jordan, Mark (2)</em><br><em>1: Islandora Foundation, Canada; 2: Simon Fraser University</em><br>Since the Islandora Foundation was first announced at Open Repositories in 2013, it has been our privilege to share a yearly update about our project and our community. 2020 was a unique year for this kind of distributed open-source project, and the community-driven approach to development and maintenance of Islandora that has sustained the project for more than a decade had to change with the times as the entire Islandora community went completely virtual. We would like to share how our community adjusted workflows, communications, and some of the fundamental ways that we work together, to keep driving an open-source repository project through a global pandemic.</p>

The 5-star LOD scheme is a set of principles that make data available to everyone and ready for reuse and distribution. This presentation aims to show how the platform Bridge of Knowledge, which was developed by Gdansk University of Technology (GUT), fulfils LOD requirements. The platform consists of several services, including an institutional repository of GUT publications, an open data repository (Bridge of Data), an inventions module and a projects module. In addition, researchers can create profiles that include information about their scientific output, achievements and research activities. Processed data are retrieved mainly from internal GUT services and organized in ways that support contextual navigation in the system. Each object is described by schema.org with JSON-LD formatting, and semantic relationships among objects foster easy navigation from one object to another, allowing Bridge of Knowledge users to discover interlinked information. This web of connections among modules makes searching more effective, not only for humans but also for machines.</p>
<p><strong>Helda Open Books &#8211; A repository-based service bringing sold-out monographs and textbooks back to life</strong><br><em>Roinila, Markku; Piipponen, Jussi</em><br><em>Helsinki university library, Finland</em><br>We present a 2020 project to publish sold-out textbooks and other monographs in the Helsinki university open repository Helda (Dspace). The project is related to a larger open monograph initiative Helda Open Books which is a collection of open monographs in the university repository where books are given persistent identifiers, their visibility is promoted and the book pages in the repository are provided with social media sharing links and altmetric tools. The background in the project is in the new acquisition policy of Helsinki University Library, emphasizing open availability of teaching materials. The problem has been that there are not enough library copies for all course students and ebooks are not necessarily available. Therefore the project strived to offer both new original open monographs for teaching as well as opening printed, but sold-out textbooks. We will concentrate on the latter objective and challenges concerning rights acquiring, scanning, publishing and metadata are discussed. Finally, we reflect on the success of the project, consider the resources required for it and report some future challenges.</p>
<p><strong>8 Terabytes of Music to Explore with DSpace-GLAM and IIIF: the Digital Library of the Milan Conservatory</strong><br><em>Crippa, Marta (2); Cortese, Claudio (1); Groppo, Emilia (1); Bollini, Andrea (1); Fazio, Riccardo (1); Scognamiglio, Francesco Pio (1)</em><br><em>1: 4Science, Italy; 2: Conservatorio &#8220;G. Verdi&#8221; di Milano, Italy</em><br>A flexible and extensible data model to enhance the relationships between digital objects and a framework to share and compare images also coming from different repositories, these are the tools provided by the DSpace-GLAM open source platform that the Milan Conservatory is using to make its Digital Library a fundamental tool for music and musicological studies. The presentation will highlight how Conservatory’s scholars took advantage of DSpace-GLAM features to build a “cultural galaxy”, comprising a vast set of different types of musical bibliographic resources linked and made explorable by means of their relationships and of the International Interoperability Framework (IIIF) to share and analyse thoroughly all the components of such galaxy.</p>

Key to this is the repository infrastructure and standards which are highly important in ensuring that repository content is discoverable and interoperable. With this in mind, providing tools to offer support and encourage good practice is a priority for OpenDOAR. As such, we have developed a new scalable and flexible infrastructure that can help repositories assess and seek guidance on international incentives and standards. This 24/7 presentation demonstrates the first iteration of our latest offering, the Repository Assessment Service (RAS). The RAS enables repositories to self-validate their level of compliance with funder requirements. Repository managers can login to the RAS to carry out their repository self-assessment by answering a series of questions. Users are presented with scores to check their current status and receive helpful guidance on how to improve their score. In this presentation, we will take an exciting tour through the RAS’s infrastructure, key features and how we envisage it being embedded into repositories’ operational workflow.</p>
<p><strong>Sherpa Services – global collaboration for an enhanced and improved service</strong><br><em>Jackson, Karen</em><br><em>Jisc, United Kingdom</em><br>Jisc’s Sherpa Services team are working to enhance, increase and improve the coverage and accuracy of our data at an international level – and we are finding that the best way to ensure full and accurate records for any given place is to be working with the local experts. We are currently running a number of collaborations with groups around the world to input, edit and curate data relating to journals and publishers in their country – in this session we aim to give an overview of some of this work and show how it is helping to add to our services.</p>
<p><strong>Publications Router: populating repositories automatically</strong><br><em>Byford, Steve (1); Rehin, Adam (1); Bollini, Andrea (2); Pascarelli, L. Andrea (2); Mornati, Susanna (2)</em><br><em>1: Jisc, UK; 2: 4Science, Italy</em><br>Institutions around the world have wrestled with how to be as efficient as possible in making their researchers’ articles openly available on their repositories. They use a variety of systems and workflows to try to achieve this. For UK institutions, Jisc’s Publications Router service works with publishers to capture articles, match them to their authors’ institutions and deliver them directly into the relevant repositories. It is now interoperable with a wider range of systems that institutions use, including research information management systems and CRISs, as well as repositories. Collaboration with 4Science, who have developed the relevant patches for the latest DSpace versions, means that Router can now deliver the full richness of RIOXX metadata fields (as well as full-text articles) into recent versions of DSpace. Parallel work includes compliance with the Research Excellence Framework (REF) in the UK, demonstrating the value of institutional repositories for research evaluation as well. Although currently aimed at UK institutions, Jisc would like to enable Router to serve institutions in additional territories. We’ll look at some of the challenges and opportunities this will entail.</p>
<p><strong>Compliance without complaints</strong><br><em>Mudd, Taylor</em><br><em>Haplo, United Kingdom</em><br>Historically repository managers have found supporting researchers to comply with a myriad of conflicting funder policies a challenge. In this presentation, Haplo will describe how they redesigned their repository system to make it easier for researchers to comply and easier for repository managers to ensure compliance.

<p><strong>Development of National-level Institutional Repository Cloud Service for Open Science</strong><br><em>Hayashi, Masaharu; Hayashi, Yutaka; Asaoka, Makoto; Kawai, Masashi; Minamiyama, Yasuyuki; Yamaji, Kazutsuna</em><br><em>National Institute of Informatics, Japan</em><br>The purpose of this study was to build a national-level institutional repository cloud service that has the extensibility of repository function and the flexibility of system operation for realizing open access to research data as a starting point of open science. WEKO3, a new repository software using Invenio framework, was developed to achieve this purpose. In particular, flexible metadata management function and customizable workflow functions were developed to provide the extensibility of repository functions. In a cloud service development using WEKO3, we applied the microservice architecture and container architecture to realize flexible system operation. As a result, WEKO3 and its cloud service realized a national-level institutional repository cloud service for open science.</p>
<p><strong>A shared governance and a sustainable funding model for HAL, the French National Open Archive</strong><br><em>Kuntziger-Planche, Bénédicte; Magron, Agnès; Fargier, Nathalie</em><br><em>Centre pour la Communication Scientifique Directe (CCSD) &#8211; CNRS, France</em><br>HAL is the French national open archive (https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/) supported by the French ministry of higher education, research and Innovation, and 3 research organisations CNRS (https://www.cnrs.fr/en), INRIA (https://inria.fr/en) and INRAÉ (https://www.inrae.fr/en). HAL provides portals for institutions allowing them managing their scientific productions. Nowadays, HAL hosts a network of 124 institutional archives for universities, research institutions and higher education schools, sharing their common publications (https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/browse/portal). The growth of HAL led to think of a new economic and a new governance model, in order to take into account the diversity of needs and to ensure the sustainability of the archive. All partners of the archive where involved in the process, leading to a new price list for institutional portals, based on the number of institutional beneficiaries of the portals, and a shared governance model for CCSD, the service unit that manages HAL. These new models will be implemented in the coming months.</p>
<p><strong>Leveraging Open Services to Enhance Institutional Research Tracking Workflows</strong><br><em>Alsaedi, Yasmeen; Grenz, Daryl; Baessa, Mohamed</em><br><em>King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia</em><br>In order to support the implementation of an institutional open access policy, adopted in 2014, the KAUST University Library developed publications tracking processes with the additional aim of making the institutional repository a reliable source for bibliographic information about the university’s research outputs.2 The code underlying these processes has now been updated and combined into an open source software application, the Institutional Research Tracking Service (IRTS), with a public version planned for release at https://github.com/kaust-library/irts prior to the conference. This presentation will briefly introduce the structure and functionality of the IRTS application and walk through the different workflows it supports, before focusing on recent enhancements to the service, especially our use of the beta version of the new Sherpa Romeo API6 and of the Unpaywall API11. We will also present an assessment of the initial effect of these improvements on the workflow, and the impact they have had on deposit rates of full text materials to the repository. Finally, we will give examples of how this service reinforces the interest of other university stakeholders in reusing the research information from the repository for purposes such as annual reporting, research evaluation, and maintenance of up-to-date publication lists on websites.</p>

<p><strong>Open for All? Addressing the Need for Regulating Access in the Disciplinary Repository PsychArchives</strong><br><em>Gerhards, Lea; Weiland, Peter; Ramthun, Roland; Baier, Christiane</em><br><em>Leibniz Institute for Psychology (ZPID), Germany</em><br>Accommodating a variety of digital research objects, including articles, preprints, research data, code, supplements, and multimedia objects, PsychArchives, the disciplinary repository for psychological science, requires a differentiated sharing level concept regulating access to and usage rights of repository content. Data sharing according to the FAIR principles is called for by more and more funding institutions, such as the European Research Council (ERC), and is increasingly a prerequisite for the publication of scientific articles in professional journals. At the same time, researchers are expected to follow recommendations on data sharing, e.g. by the German Psychological Society (DGPs), which – taking into account European and national data protection laws – postulate that a restriction of access to research data is sometimes warranted. Providing a solution for this complex situation, PsychArchives offers a number of different sharing levels, ranging from open and immediate access to more restrictive access categories. Each sharing level is equipped with specific licensing options. Allowing for the allocation of sharing levels on the level of individual files, PsychArchives presents a flexible and granular solution for archiving and making accessible psychological research output in line with best practice standards, recommendations by scientific societies as well as ethical and data protection requirements.</p>
<p><strong>4TU.ResearchData: Building the community</strong><br><em>Clare, Connie</em><br><em>4TU.ResearchData, Netherlands</em><br>4TU.ResearchData is an international data repository for science, engineering and design. Established as an initiative of three Dutch technical universities; TU Delft, TU/Eindhoven and the University of Twente, 4TU.ResearchData is a cross-institutional collaboration that supports researchers with making their data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR). The recent migration of content to Figshare provided researchers with a repository that boasts new features, including integration with GitHub and publication of confidential data under embargo. Despite these technical advancements, 4TU.ResearchData appreciates that providing ‘good’ technical infrastructure is not sufficient to make data FAIR and drive a culture change toward Open Science. Community building is essential to provide researchers with discipline-specific support and guidance. The goal of the 4TU.ResearchData community, which includes data stewards, data supporters and researchers from the partner institutions, is to provide an inclusive space for exchanging knowledge and best data sharing practices. Programming includes working groups, community calls, an online platform and blog to publicise achievements of community members. News and events are also shared in a monthly newsletter. Future programming includes launching calls for applications for the ‘FAIR Data Fund’, and the development of a global Fellowship Programme to advance 4TU.ResearchData’s mission and vision of FAIR data.</p>
<p><strong>Shared repositories: building (multi-tenancy) repository services at the British Library</strong><br><em>Gould, Sara; Basford, Jenny; Reimer, Torsten</em><br><em>The British Library, United Kingdom</em><br>In 2018, a report by the Universities UK Open Access Repositories Working Group raised concerns about repository sustainability and proposed a range actions that could support open repositories. It also posed the question of whether the integration of separate institutional repositories and increased use of shared services might help to pool resources, reduce costs and increase visibility, citation and impact. While shared repositories are still unusual, in November 2019, the British Library launched its shared open access repository. It brings together the research outputs of six cultural heritage organisations – available as separate repositories as well as a shared search interface at https://iro.bl.uk. To our knowledge, it is the first example of a shared repository that takes advantage of the multi-tenancy features of the open source Samvera Hyku repository system. This paper discusses both the nature, challenge and benefits of developing a multi-tenant repository system, and the BL’s progress towards a shared repository service for a wider range of partner organisations. Based on the lessons learned so far, we will discuss the potential of open source-based, shared repositories to contribute to an open knowledge environment, and how this project already opened up previously closed content.</p>

<h2>Developer track session 1</h2>
<p><strong>Session notes doc </strong></p>
<p><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EcVOX7NsNUJ5AxVAEb8chRo5Hmuf8UIzNWWT3QraiUg" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EcVOX7NsNUJ5AxVAEb8chRo5Hmuf8UIzNWWT3QraiUg</a><br></strong><br><strong>CAPE: A javascript clientside repository</strong><br><em>Gutteridge, Christopher James</em><br><em>University of Southampton, United Kingdom</em><br>At Southampton we used to use EPrints to create “microrepositories” which are basically using the repository as a way to interact with a research dataset. This is expensive and not very sustainable. Sustainability of small research-output websites is an ongoing issue as many have complex and bespoke back end needs. To address both of these we’ve developed a pure javascript repository system called CAPE which uses a JSON file for the metadata and field configuration. It’s a work in progress but other people may find either the tool or the ideas useful. I would be giving a live tour of the tool and it’s features. I can prerecord. It would be based on this blog post</p>
<p><strong>The IOI App: How and why to establish an institutional ORCID integration outside of your repository platform</strong><br><em>Alsaedi, Yasmeen; Grenz, Daryl; Baessa, Mohamed</em><br><em>King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia</em><br>For many institutions, their ability to integrate with ORCID is hindered by the absence of robust integration support within their repository software. While progress has been made in some platforms, overall the enthusiasm for ORCID in the repository community has not translated into fully integrated solutions easily adopted by large numbers of universities, often leaving them frustrated in their efforts to pursue system integrations with ORCID. Our own initial integration between our DSpace repository and ORCID provided minimum functionality and relied on a manual process for transfer of information into the repository. Recently, we have revamped our tool into a more fully featured institutional ORCID integration directly connected to DSpace via REST API and released it as an open source software application. This presentation will introduce the structure and functionality of the IOI application as well as demonstrate how it can be configured for reuse by other institutions with a variety of needs. We will also explain why we foresee continuing to maintain an institutional ORCID integration as a service closely connected to, but separate from, the main institutional repository platform.</p>
<p><strong>Developing COrDa: The COmmunity Orcid Dashboard</strong><br><em>Vials Moore, Adam (1); Duke, Monica (1); Wallis, Kirsty (2); Stephens, Owen (3)</em><br><em>1: Jisc, United Kingdom; 2: University College London; 3: Owen Stephens Consulting Ltd</em><br>The Community ORCID Dashboard is a project to bring together multiple sources of institutional and open data around ORCID iD and rationalise them into one central reporting and visualisation offering.</p>
<p><strong>Two features, 10 lines of code</strong><br><em>Mudd, Taylor</em><br><em>Haplo, United Kingdom</em><br>A well-designed plugin API speeds up development of new features for open source repositories and enables developers to deliver new functionality in a seamless user experience. During this demonstration the presenter will add two fully integrated features to a Haplo Repository application using only 10 lines of code.</p>
<p><strong>Logical Item Filtering in DSpace</strong><br><em>Shepherd, Kim Michael; Becker, Pascal-Nicolas</em><br><em>The Library Code GmbH</em><br>The ability to logically filter items in DSpace using Spring configuration introduces powerful new ways to apply existing tools conditionally. This presentation discusses a use case where items should only have a new DOI registered under certain circumstances, eg: metadata matches a regular expression, or some number of bitstreams are present. To support this functionality, The Library Code developed a new spring-based item logic filtering service inspired by the filtering configuration used in XOAI. The DSpace logical item filter supports complete boolean algebra. This service allows boolean logical statements of varying complexity to define new filters which can then be used by other services to test items, and act accordingly on the result. The result of an item test is ultimately determined by a set of simple Java classes that inspect an item and return a boolean value. These conditions are easy to add and extend, making any kind of item-level test possible. In this presentation we review the item filter code, show the result of wiring a filter service into the DSpace DOI provider, and provide demonstrations of filtering under various conditions. Other potential applications of logical item filtering will also be covered.</p>

This popular panel, featured since Open Repositories 2016 in Dublin, offers a broad overview of the main repository platforms at Open Repositories and provides an opportunity for spirited discussion amongst panelists and virtual attendees. Join community representatives from Dataverse, DSpace, EPrints, Fedora, Haplo, Invenio, Islandora, and Samvera as we briefly explain what each of our repositories actually does. We&#8217;ll also talk about the directions of our respective technical and community developments and related to the conference theme of “Open for all”, we’ll discuss the role of our repositories in supporting knowledge in the service of society, enabling local knowledge sharing, and supporting those beyond the conventional academic sphere. This panel will be a great opportunity for newcomers to Open Repositories to get a crash course on the major repository options and meet representatives from each of their communities. After a brief presentation from each representative, we&#8217;ll open the session up for questions from the virtual audience.</p>

However, over the last year, IRUS has been improved in various ways that expand the service’s ability to support open knowledge. The presentation will go over three areas of improvement. First, Hannah Rosen will be discussing recent IRUS updates, which, among other things, has introduced COUNTER Release 5 conformance, removed barriers to viewing IR usage statistics and now facilitates international usage, sharing, and awareness. Then Jo Lambert will be talking specifically about use cases surrounding knowledge sharing related to the COVID-19 pandemic within IRUS. Finally, Jim Ottaviani will be presenting on the challenges and benefits of using the new IRUS interface across multiple repositories in a single institution.</p>

<p><strong>Elevating Open Data: Building an Accessible Environment for Data Stewardship in Research Libraries with CADRE</strong><br><em>Wilkinson, Jaci (1); Wittenberg, Jamie V. (2); Mabry, Patricia L. (3); Pentchev, Valentin (4); Van Rennes, Robert (5); Fridmanski, Ethan (1)</em><br><em>1: Indiana University Libraries; 2: University Libraries, University of Colorado Boulder; 3: HealthPartners; 4: Indiana University Network Science Institute; 5: Big Ten Academic Alliance</em><br>Libraries that can afford to purchase big datasets often cannot provide infrastructure to store, secure, and maintain data&#8211;or provide a viable data-mining interface for users who are not proficient coders. The Collaborative Archive &amp; Data Research Environment (CADRE) aims to address these issues with a cloud-based infrastructure that integrates a shared repository of big bibliometric data into a science gateway with standardized text- and data-mining capabilities. CADRE facilitates collaboration and elevates open practices by developing an open source science gateway that provides access to a repository of open and non-consumptive datasets, GUI querying capabilities, shared data-analysis tools, and reproducible research. This community-built cyberinfrastructure is supported by 11 university libraries across two academic consortia. Now in its beta phase, the CADRE project is in the final stages of a sustainability plan, ensuring a complete tiered-pricing plan and sustainability model will be available for interested researchers at the Open Repositories 2021 conference.</p>
<p><strong>Using Research Profiles as a Service (RPaS) to Populate an Institutional Repository</strong><br><em>Gambill, Agnes</em><br><em>Appalachian State University, United States of America</em><br>Populating an institutional repository at any academic university can be a challenge. Doing so in the middle of a global health crisis adds further complexities. So, how can librarians and repository managers create momentum and interest in IRs during COVID-19? One solution includes offering Research Profiles as a Service (RPaS). RPaS was developed at Appalachian State University to help faculty members build their online presence and increase their awareness and engagement with the university’s institutional repository. Response rates to RPaS service inquiries were dramatically more than response rates to article ingest submissions. Furthermore, RPaS requests led to more article ingest submissions than compared to traditional methods of IR outreach. This presentation will discuss the reason for creating RPaS and illustrate how and why it works.</p>
<p><strong>Swallow Beyond the Repository: Development of a Custom Metadata Management Software</strong><br><em>Neugebauer, Tomasz; Berrizbeitia, Francisco</em><br><em>Concordia University, Canada</em><br>Swallow is a custom-built open source software solution that facilitates a common need in digital collections projects: the aggregation of metadata describing digital objects of cultural or scientific significance held at many sources. The software was developed out of the goals of the SpokenWeb SSHRC Partnership Grant research network to digitize, process, describe, and aggregate the metadata of a diverse range of sound collections documenting literary and cultural activity in Canada since the 1950s. In this presentation, we introduce Swallow, the principles that drove its development, and briefly outline the context of documentary literary sound recordings and some recent developments with literary events moving online due to restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>Repository Migration: How it started, How it’s going</strong><br><em>Homenda, Nicholas; Hardesty, Juliet L.</em><br><em>Indiana University Libraries, United States of America</em><br>Indiana University is in the process of migrating digital collections from Fedora 3 to Fedora 4. Since our 2018 presentation “The Ecosystem of Repository Migration,” we have learned that the services and application are even more front and center to repository migration than we originally thought. For us, this has looked like launching new Digital Collections and Archives Online services and contracting with a software development company, Notch8. We will share the lessons learned that starting simple does not just involve the least complicated digital objects, it also applies to keeping service and application upgrades to the minimum needed for a viable product.</p>
<p><strong>Increasing the A in OA: How accessibility work in repositories should influence publisher agreements</strong><br><em>Roosa, Sadie</em><br><em>MIT Libraries, United States of America</em><br>The majority of publishers, even those making articles open through gold or green OA routes, are only making those articles open to a portion of the public: those who can read PDFs as they are displayed on a screen or printed on paper. As more and more academic libraries negotiate with publishers on agreements to transform scholarly publishing, we have an opportunity and responsibility to push for increased accessibility of open access content that publishers provide. To highlight the impact agreements with publishers could have on the accessibility of open content in our institutional repositories, I’ll share results of an analysis of DSpace@MIT’s Open Access Articles collection. This analysis will show the accessibility status of content deposited both directly and indirectly from publishers between 2009 and 2020. I will then focus in on multiple changes that would benefit green OA, tying them in with other trends in publisher agreements, like auto-deposit and open licensing. I’ll lay out multiple hypothetical agreements and how each one would improve the numbers and percentages of accessible articles in our repository.</p>
<p><strong>We’ve got a Digital Repository: now what do we do with it?</strong><br><em>Reynolds, Kent Douglas;&nbsp;Parisi,&nbsp;Bianca;&nbsp;Rigg, Cindy<br></em><em>Niagara College Canada, Canada</em><br>Until this pandemic, Niagara College’s digital repository was primarily an institutional archive. We thought of it as a place to put “things that needed a home.” Niagara College owns one instance of CORe, a multi-site Islandora repository, shared by seven Canadian colleges. Initially, Niagara College library began populating its repository with historical artifacts and other items of significance. The librarians reached out to various departments, yet despite great interest, little happened. Then, the pandemic changed everything. The last day of in-person service at our library was March 13, 2020. Services like course reserves that required the physical presence of workers to digitize and manage resources for students and faculty were gone, and instructors were scrambling for online teaching and learning tools. We reached out to our faculty again offering the repository, this time, as a solution for teaching and learning during the pandemic. The result was rapid ingesting of learning resources. We all started thinking about our repository as a resource to fill the gaps in physical services. The pandemic provided us all with an opportunity to re-think our digital repository, re-purposing it to meet the sudden and urgent demand to support acadmic teaching and learning online.</p>

<p><strong>Cataloging of Biological Datasets in AgDados &#8211; the Embrapa Data Repository</strong><br><em>Souza, Marcia Izabel Fugisawa; Nhani Junior, Antonio; Giachetto, Poliana Fernanda; Kuser-Falcao, Paula Regina; Cintra, Leandro Carrijo; Barbosa, Luiz Antonio Falaguasta; Cunha, Luiz Manoel Silva; Visoli, Marcos Cezar; Torres, Tercia Zavaglia</em><br><em>Embrapa Agricultural Informatics, Brazil</em><br>Within the scope of a pilot project to implement omic data management actions, conducted by the Multiuser Laboratory of Bioinformatics of the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa), and the Information Engineering Research Group (GPEI), from Embrapa Informática Agropecuária, the task of cataloging data sets in the Embrapa Data Repository (AgDados) was defined as a priority. The purpose of the reported study was to define and establish minimum rules for cataloging biological datasets in the AgDados, guided by international standards for descriptive cataloging; and compatible with the FAIR principles. In this process, four aspects were determined: minimum rules for describing datasets; metadata elements compatible with the Dataverse software; set of common attributes to guide the description of metadata elements; rules to guide the completion of each element, field of Citation Metadata and Life Science Metadata. These results compose a set of basic rules for cataloging datasets, and are intended to support the cataloger during the task of describing the data within the AgDados. The study presents an effective contribution to: organization and systematization of the main activities of cataloging biological datasets in AgDados; generation of qualified metadata in accordance with international standards of descriptive representation, and compatible with the FAIR principles.</p>
<p><strong>Preserving Podcasts: An Institutional Repository Case Study</strong><br><em>Moore, Erik A.; Collins, Valerie M.</em><br><em>University of Minnesota, United States of America</em><br>In response to the 2020 global pandemic, the University of Minnesota Archives sought to gather digital content documenting the public health crisis and institutional response to COVID-19. Staff identified university produced podcasts from several departments as information-rich contemporaneous content that was also at high risk of loss. Staff conducted a campus-wide survey to identify content and types of platforms to determine the steps to ingest podcasts into the institutional repository. The outcomes demonstrate that the use of an institutional repository to preserve podcast content provides many of the same benefits as for other types of traditional repository content. The inclusion of podcast media in IRs also demonstrates how moving beyond traditional academic content and formats helps to reach a broader, more community-focused audience and user base, increasing the repository impact with those outside of the academic context.</p>
<p><strong>Hodgepodge or Showcase?</strong><br><em>McMillan, Gail</em><br><em>Virginia Tech, United States of America</em><br>Since the IR may serve the institution as a digital library, it should accurately reflect the institution’s scholarship and activities. But how can we determine whether this is the case? This study proposes selecting several microcosms, creating a controlled vocabulary of terms and phrases, searching the vocabulary at the institution-level and in the IR, and comparing the percentage of hits in each. Assessing IRs from the perspective of its content is not a frame of reference generally used. This study compared three microcosms in the IR with the same microcosms in the institution at large&#8211;LGBTQ, Indigenous People, and Latinx. What percentage of similarity be considered a close enough correlation? While this is a review of one IR at a doctoral-granting land grant institution, a discussion of the methodology and results could lead to cross-IR analyses. This presentation will describe developing the vocabularies, search strategies using the advantages and short-comings of Google and Solr, and what the data revealed about VTechWorks, the IR at Virginia Tech. Studying these microcosms within the IR also revealed the use or non-use of terms and phrases by certain author communities, e.g., graduate students through their ETDs and faculty through their published articles.</p>

<p><strong>Navigating OA eBook usage data stakeholder interests to facilitate cross-platform data exchange</strong><br><em>Drummond, Christina</em><br><em>Educopia Institute, United States of America</em><br>Originating in 2015, the OA eBook Usage (OAeBU) Data Trust effort has brought over 100 individuals across five continents together to surface and address the issues that complicate the analysis and use of book usage metrics for decision making and open access advocacy worldwide. In its current pilot phase supported by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the project has documented the complex OAeBU data supply chain, piloted open-source infrastructure for a data trust, and facilitated stakeholder led design thinking workshops to create detailed OAeBU personas and use cases. As it prepares for its operational launch, the project is developing governance and sustainability models to support the community infrastructure while meeting diverse public/private stakeholder needs and managing nuanced international data sharing regulations involving privacy, security and ethical third-party data use. After a brief project introduction, Christina Drummond, the OAeBU Data Trust Program Officer, will note tensions that may complicate the ability for neutral, core community infrastructure to facilitate cross-platform public/private data exchange while providing data visualizations to target audiences. She will also note how the effort is navigating standards and process related opportunities that surfaced during the pilot. In closing, repository managers will learn how to join the effort.</p>
<p><strong>DataCite Service Providers program: Bringing the power of DOIs to a system near you</strong><br><em>Krznarich, Liz</em><br><em>DataCite, United States of America</em><br>In order for repositories to leverage the power of DOIs, it’s essential that DOI registration is well-integrated into popular repository software platforms. After a series of community focus groups, DataCite launched its registered Service Providers program in July 2020 (https://blog.datacite.org/datacite-registered-service-providers-providing-doi-registration-functionality-to-datacite-members) with the goals of ensuring best practice adoption, enabling 2-way communication between DataCite and system developers, and providing repositories with resources about DataCite integrations. This presentation will provide an overview of the DataCite Service Providers program, including information about how to become a registered service provider and how to find resources related to DataCite integrations in repository systems.</p>
<p><strong>Reopening the Repository: Redeveloping ScholarSphere to support Open Access</strong><br><em>Coughlin, Daniel; Erickson, Seth; Wead, Adam</em><br><em>Penn State University, United States of America</em><br>Penn State released its institutional repository in 2012. After many years in production, we decided the only way to meet our new challenges was to completely rewrite the software. With the new version of ScholarSphere, we aimed to implement new features, use more sustainable frameworks, improve application architecture, modernize our infrastructure, and create opportunities to support open access. We spent just over one year in development and this presentation will focus on what we did, why we made the decisions we made, what went well and not-so well, and where we are heading in 2021 and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>Sustaining Open Infrastructure Communities: Evaluating Fiscal and Administrative Service Options</strong><br><em>Greer Klein, Heather (1); Metz, Rosalyn (2)</em><br><em>1: Samvera, United States of America; 2: Emory University, United States of America</em><br>Over the past two years, the Samvera Community has implemented structures meant to ensure sustainability of the Community, these include: an elected governing body; a contribution model; and the hiring of a Community Manager. The Community’s existing fiscal sponsorship agreement was set to expire in mid-2021, and could not be renewed without a change to both the terms of the agreement and the rate charged for services. The Samvera Community recognized an opportunity to critically evaluate the Community’s fiscal and organizational needs and to explore the options available in both the library open infrastructure community as well as the wider open source software landscape. This presentation will review the critical role of fiscal sustainability in open infrastructure communities; common models for this relationship; and the process Samvera used to evaluate fiscal and administrative needs against the options available in the open market. We will also present how the newly selected fiscal sponsor for Samvera represents an innovative model that is becoming more common in the wider free and open source software ecosystem. This model could help other open infrastructure projects seeking to ensure the best fit for financial, legal, and community leadership sustainability.</p>
<p><strong>An Engaged Campus Repository in Practice: The University of Minnesota’s Institutional Repository and the Pandemic Response</strong><br><em>Moore, Erik A.; Collins, Valerie M.; Johnston, Lisa R.</em><br><em>University of Minnesota, United States of America</em><br>Institutional repositories (IRs) provide more than open access to scholarly materials; they also provide timely and persistent access to community-focused resources serving as a “common good” for a publicly-engaged university promoting scholarship and research on their campus. This presentation will explore the fundamentals of what it means to provide repository services for public engagement and highlight strategies to incorporate the repository as a key component in community-engaged work. It will then provide an example based on the public engagement work at the University of Minnesota demonstrating how the institutional repository became a central tool for publicly-engaged offices to reach their communities in the COVID-19 pandemic response.</p>
<p><strong>Taking (small) steps towards accessible repository content</strong><br><em>Maistrovskaya, Mariya</em><br><em>University of Toronto Libraries, Canada</em><br>In this brief overview we will share the steps and strategies the University of Toronto Libraries is taking towards improving content accessibility in its IR. The University of Toronto is the largest institution in Canada with a well established IR of 90,000+items, primarily in PDF format. Our strategies include an addition of the accessibility provision to the submission policy, accessibility check and remediation for mediated deposit submissions, and training for content creators. We hope that the resources, policies and procedures we have developed will help other repository managers along this path.</p>

<p><strong>Notify &#8211; The Repository and Services Interoperability Project</strong><br><em>Shearer, Kathleen (1); Klein, Martin (2); Walk, Paul (1)</em><br><em>1: COAR, International; 2: Los Alamos National Laboratory, USA</em><br>COAR has been promoting a new and exciting future for scholarly communications. This vision was first outlined in the COAR Next Generation Repositories Initiative and further articulated in the Pubfair White Paper, which describes a distributed framework for open publishing services. In 2020, COAR published a generic technical model to enable the linking of preprints and other repository resources with external services, with an initial focus on peer review services. The technical model – which was developed based on a number of use cases provided by preprint servers, repositories, peer review services and overlay journals – applies a distributed, message-oriented approach based on W3C Linked Data Notifications (LDN). As a next step, in January 2021, COAR launched the Notify: The Repositories and Services Interoperability Project to assist early adopters in implementing a common and interoperable model that will support reviews and endorsements on distributed resources in repositories, preprints and archives. This presentation will present an overview of the technologies underpinning this model, and provide an update of the work-to-date and outcomes of the project.</p>
<p><strong>On building a tool for finding datasets based on a list of researchers or publications</strong><br><em>Carvalho-Segundo, Washington L. R. (1); Dias, Thiago M. R. (2)</em><br><em>1: Brazilian Institute of Information in Science and Technology (IBICT), Brazil; 2: Federal Center for Technological Education of Minas Gerais (CEFET-MG), Brazil</em><br>​This proposal presents a tool developed in the Python language used to find related datasets of a list of researchers or publications. This tool was applied to a list of articles that a specific group of researchers had declared in their CVs. The target group was chosen based on the highest level that these researchers had obtained in a research productivity grant (1A). As a result, form a list of 1,227 researchers and more than 225 thousand deduplicated publications, it was possible to find 12,030 related datasets, were the most frequent access type is OPEN and the five most frequent related areas of research are Zoology; Chemistry; Genetics; Physics; and Agronomy. The proposed tool will be applied to facilitate populating the research data repository of the national funding agency in Brazil, but it can also be used in other more general contexts, extracting information from open databases, such as ORCID and Wikidata.</p>
<p><strong>From Hard Drives to Globus: Supporting new workflows for large data transfer in libraries</strong><br><em>Handren, Kara; Leahey, Amber; Newson, Kaitlin</em><br><em>Scholars Portal, Ontario Council of University Libraries, Canada</em><br>As data continues to grow in size and volume, there is an equally growing need to provide new technical solutions to support large data transfer within academic library data services. This search for digital solutions became even more urgent with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, as restrictions on contact meant that existing workflows were no longer possible in a remote environment. This presentation summarizes recent work by Scholars Portal, a consortial library technology service, to develop infrastructure to support the transfer of big data in delivering library data services to students and researchers. It will focus on the use of Globus, a large data transfer tool, and workflows for integration into two different data repository systems &#8211; Dataverse &amp; Scholars GeoPortal. We will discuss current workflows for the transfer of large files, and some of the use cases in academic libraries both now and into the future.</p>

<p><strong>Panel: &#8220;Broken for All&#8221;: the case for persistent identifiers for digital cultural heritage resources</strong><br><em>Turner, Adrian (1); Holmes-Wong, Deborah (2); Rafique, Zahid (2); Kunze, John (1); Lohnash, Megan (3); McKinley, Matthew (4), Lund,&nbsp;Allison&nbsp;(5)</em><br><em>1: California Digital Library; 2: University of Southern California Libraries; 3: California Revealed; 4: Omeka; 5: Metropolitan New York Library Council&nbsp;</em><br>Cultural heritage institutions within the United States have made significant investments in building unique digital collections, broadly disseminating them on the web and through networks such as the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA). The items within these collections are referenced and cited in a range of sources &#8212; from Wikipedia and scholarly articles, to archival finding aids and classroom lesson plans. However, the application of persistent identifier schemes (e.g. DOI, ARK) for unique digital resources is relatively uncommon within the gallery, library, archive, and museum communities. Relatedly, many repositories and digital asset management systems (DAMS) widely used in these communities simply do not support persistent identifier schemes &#8220;out of the box.&#8221; Hence, the URLs for the items are extremely fragile. If the collections are migrated to a different repository, the URLs can easily break &#8212; impacting downstream networks, confounding researchers, and compounding the problem of link rot. This panel will discuss the critical role of persistent identifiers in digital collections management and dissemination and some of the challenges in applying them. It will feature case studies demonstrating how commonly-available licensed and open-source repositories can be adapted to support them.</p>

<p><strong>Arkisto: a repository based platform for managing all kinds of research data</strong><br><em>Sefton, Peter (1); La Rosa, Marco (2); Lynch, Michael (1)</em><br><em>1: University of Technology Sydney; 2: University of Melbourne</em><br>Arkisto is a comprehensive research data management platform which is based on the use of standards for storing and describing data with a view to making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR). Central to Arkisto is the notion of a repository of data, using the OCFL (Oxford Common Filesystem Layout) standard to keep data organized and accessible over the long term, with separate services to acquire data, build discovery indexes, run preservation activities and provide access to analytical software. An Arkisto repository consists of a collection of datasets, stored as OCFL Objects where each Object is described using the Research Object Crate (RO-Crate) metadata standard &#8211; at least to the level of dataset, but potentially to the level of individual file resources, or the variables or other semantics within files. There are a number of tools which have been developed under the Arkisto banner, though any tool which works with the standards can be considered a part of the platform. This presentation will explain the motivation for the platform, and give several examples of its use, as an Institutional Research Data repository, for special collections of various kinds, as well as lab-level research data repositories for instrument and field-sensor data.</p>
<p><strong>Research Object Crate (RO-Crate) Update</strong><br><em>Sefton, Peter (1); Soiland-Reyes, Stian (2)</em><br><em>1: University of Technology Sydney; 2: The University of Manchester</em><br>RO-Crate is a means of describing and aggregating research data. It was introduced at Open Repositories 2019 as a marriage of the Research Object standard for describing reusable data objects and Datacrate, a data packing specification. Research data is increasingly important to the OR community and some aspects of the standard are particularly relevant to a community where metadata is a key concern: the use of linked data; schema.org as a code vocabulary; the Portland Common Data Model for representing and interchanging repository content; and having a built-in HTML view of object metadata for offline and online objects. RO-Crate is seeing increased adoption and interest in the research data management world and is relevant to research data repositories and data discovery. This presentation will provide an update on the standard with examples on its use.</p>
<p><strong>A Causal Analysis of the Progress of Green Open Access</strong><br><em>Kawai, Masashi (1), Ojiro, Koichi (1), Maeda, Jun (2), Nishizawa, Masaki (1), Yamaji, Kazutsuna (1)<br>1:&nbsp;National Institute of Informatics, Japan; 2: Hokkaido University</em><br>More than 800 institutional repositories exist in Japan, but only a few institutions are active in registering journal articles. In this study, we analyzed the causal relation between the number of journal articles and librarians’ open access promotion initiatives to provide good practice guidelines to the institutional repository community. Quantitative analysis results using data from 87 domestic institutions showed “sending a request for fulltext”, a direct approach to researchers, was estimated particularly influential in increasing the number of journal articles. On the other hand, initiatives, for instance, in developing an “open access policy” or implementing “self-archiving” were found less influential. Additional collected data from 4 institutions regarding the “sending a request for fulltext” to understand the details of the causal relation revealed an annual success rate averaged 36.32%. Furthermore, the data showed the annual success rate of an institution implementing it most effectively averaged 55.82%, reaching a peak of 73.20%.</p>
<p><strong>Next Generation Repositories: Best laid plans</strong><br><em>Holm, Tanya</em><br><em>University of New South Wales (UNSW), Sydney, Australia</em><br>UNSW Library is migrating its institutional repository to a new platform, DSpace7. UNSW’s vision is to provide next generation infrastructure that enables UNSW research to be discoverable locally and globally. Since DSpace7 is still in development, a prototype was developed for UNSW in 2020 and evaluated against COAR’s guiding principles and design assumptions of next generation repositories. The presentation will reflect on the process of evaluating repository technology according to the COAR criteria while balancing the specific needs of the institution and users. It will also examine some of the challenges of implementation, which has brought to light the kinds of practical considerations, technical requirements and user expectations that often waylay best intentions.</p>

<p><strong>Constructing a Repository Test Strategy Built on Docker Containers</strong><br><em>Brady, Terrence W</em><br><em>California Digital Library, United States of America</em><br>The Merritt Digital Preservation system comprises a dozen microservices and supporting services. Our team found that it was not cost effective to maintain and patch a fleet of servers to support a development environment. Our solution was to replace our development server environment with a stack of dockerized services. Once the stack was containerized, we discovered that we were able to create 3 variants of our development stack with different persistence strategies for database content and cloud storage. With these variants, the team has been able to support a variety of testing scenarios.</p>
<p><strong>Deploying a Serverless Application as a Docker Image</strong><br><em>Brady, Terrence W</em><br><em>California Digital Library, United States of America</em><br>A serverless application consists of a defined runtime (such as Ruby 2.7 or Python 3) and a package of code. This presentation will illustrate 3 types of code packages of different complexity and will describe the challenges of bundling more complicated dependencies such as binary files. In December 2020, the AWS Lambda serverless architecture began to support Docker images as a deployment package. This packaging approach makes it possible to run tests against a code package before it is deployed. This presentation will demonstrate the test and deployment process for a serverless application within the Merritt digital preservation system. Other repository teams hosting their applications on AWS may discover some useful patterns for testing and deploying serverless code to AWS Lambda.</p>
<p><strong>Live Demo: Create a Developer Workspace Challenge</strong><br><em>Pottinger, Hardy Joseph</em><br><em>California Digital Library, University of California, Office of the President, United States of America</em><br>Creating a developer workspace, a place in which you can write and test your code, can seem a daunting task. Sure, someone might have done it before, and they might even share their notes with you, but following those notes and arriving in the same place is like following a treasure map and expecting to get rich. There’s a better way, and I’m willing to prove it. This demo aims to show the process one goes through to craft a development environment with pretty much any tool, but will use Lando to conserve time. Lando is a way to bootstrap a useable development environment. It&#8217;s built on Docker, and is like Docker-Compose, but much more transparent. It handles the boring details and helps you actually start developing with code in your favorite IDE, and all the services you need in Docker. It&#8217;s all about making the life of a developer easier. It won&#8217;t give you an application container you can deploy, but you will develop a deeper understanding of how all the pieces fit together, and you&#8217;ll have a tool which can deploy those pieces to dev/stage/prod if you wish. The audience will participate in this demo.</p>
<p><strong>Building Scalable Serverless Digital Repositories using Amplify Open-source Framework</strong><br><em>Chen, Yinlin; Jiang, Tingting; Hunter, Lee</em><br><em>Virginia Tech, United States of America</em><br>We develop digital repositories to disseminate different types of digital content and to promote the principles of open access. Our goal is not to provide access to information to just one individual institution or group but to anyone and everyone. With that ambitious goal in mind, how do we enable our digital repositories to have the high availability and flexible scaling capabilities necessary to face unforeseen demand? How do we utilize only the resources we need without the waste of overprovisioning resources? These are some of the most challenging issues that we face. To achieve our goals, we moved from the traditional monolithic, server-based approach to serverless cloud infrastructure. By leveraging the services that AWS provides we have been able to boost the performance of our repositories 10x compared to that of our previous implementation that was hosted in-house. Our repositories now automatically scale up and down to meet any kind of traffic demands, without our intervention. In this talk, we will demonstrate our scalable serverless digital repositories and show the opportunities to explore and reflect on the ways that repositories enable openness for all.</p>

<p><strong>Repositories, are you ready to ROR?</strong><br><em>Gould, Maria (2); Krznarich, Liz (1); Lowenberg, Daniella (2)</em><br><em>1: DataCite; 2: California Digital Library</em><br>Repositories have been strong adopters of open persistent identifiers (PIDs), and, in many cases, they have come to rely on PIDs as an integral part of their systems. While open PIDs for content and people have existed for some time, no open identifier for research organizations has existed&#8230;until now! With the launch of the Research Organization Registry (ROR), it’s now possible to unambiguously connect organizations to content and people using an open, community-led organization registry. This talk will provide an introduction to ROR and its services, explore an example implementation in the Dryad Digital Repository, and discuss future opportunities/needs for ROR adoption among repositories.</p>
<p><strong>Next Generation Library Publishing project: Integrating open-source IR and publishing solutions</strong><br><em>Mitchell, Catherine (1); Skinner, Katherine (2); Ratan, Kristen (3)</em><br><em>1: California Digital Library, University of California; 2: Educopia Institute; 3: Stratos</em><br>Commercial publishers, platform-builders, and service providers derive enormous profits within the scholarly communication industry through aggressive and opaque business practices that are often at odds with the values that drive academic research and scholarship. Academy-led and campus-based alternatives exist, including a growing range of open access library publishers, but they need more robust, flexible, and interoperable tools and workflows to provide competitive scholarly publishing services to editors and scholars. The library publishing community seeks open-source, community-governed solutions and a modular architecture that can mix existing and new technologies. Through the Next Generation Library Publishing project (2019-22, funded by Arcadia Fund), Educopia, California Digital Library (CDL) and Strategies for Open Science (Stratos), in collaboration with COAR, LYRASIS, and Longleaf Services, aim to advance the role of the institution in scholarly communication via the following deliverables: &#8211; -Targeted technology projects to fill gaps and share data between existing open-source platforms (DSpace, OJS, and Janeway) &#8211; -A values &amp; principles framework for the evaluation of vendors and technology partners &#8211; -A catalog of open-source tools and platforms available for scholarly publishing &#8211; -Mission-aligned service providers to host and manage this open infrastructure for library publishers and IR managers Join us to learn more about this project!</p>
<p><strong>Dataset Search: An open source tool to support data discovery, reuse, and analytics</strong><br><em>Mannheimer, Sara; Clark, Jason A.; Espeland, James; Schultz, Jakob; Borland, Rhonda; Hagerman, Kyle; Laden, Daniel</em><br><em>Montana State University, United States of America</em><br>A number of recent projects focus on indexing research data repositories, using various strategies. Montana State University (MSU) Library aims to bring together the ideas of these existing projects, as well as some innovations, to encourage discovery and reuse of datasets from MSU researchers. MSU librarians gave a presentation at OR2018 in which we walked through an early prototype of the MSU Dataset Search tool. This presentation will update the Open Repositories community on the completed tool, launched in January 2020. The goals of the tool are: (1) promote discovery for datasets from MSU; (2) present MSU research data in one central index; (3) support discovery for restricted data; and (4) showcase research data as a legitimate research product that can be cited, reused, shared, and analyzed—including data dashboards that provide new transparency and visualizations of research data in our community. We will also present a technical discussion of how the software works and design decisions that we considered. We will finish the session by discussing lessons learned, Search Engine Optimization efforts, the potential for this tool to be implemented at other small and mid-sized institutions, and national data discovery initiatives.</p>

<p><strong>Results from the OpenAIRE Call for Innovation: Enrich local data via the OpenAIRE Graph</strong><br><em>Bollini, Andrea (1); Mornati, Susanna (1); Digilio, Giuseppe (1); Piščanc, Jordan (2); Artini, Michele (3); Atzori, Claudio (3)</em><br><em>1: 4Science, Italy; 2: University of Trieste, Italy; 3: ISTI-CNR, Italy</em><br>In the context of the OpenAIRE Open Innovation programme, 4Science proposed the project named “Enrich local data via the OpenAIRE Graph” to develop two data products for the repository community, and more specifically for the DSpace and DSpace-CRIS platforms. The solutions were built on top of the OpenAIRE Research Graph and the OpenAIRE Broker Service to enrich the data locally available and identify new data of interest reducing the friction of deposit. The Open Innovation programme selects innovative projects in the field of Open Science to develop products and services linked to scholarly works, repositories, data management, OpenAIRE infrastructure and OpenAIRE services. The 4Science proposal was awarded in 2020 and went through an accurate process of design, validation, prototyping and finalization of the solution, in continuous dialogue with the OpenAIRE team and gathering feedback from the repository community as well. In Feb 2021 the project was completed after a pilot phase with the University of Trieste, and the implemented solution was released as free open source. This presentation aims to show the developed solution and discuss how collaboration between large initiatives such OpenAIRE and repository platforms can enrich both.</p>
<p><strong>ORCID and OpenAIRE Compliance for DSpace</strong><br><em>Matthews, Courtney Earl (1); Roy, William (1); Bollini, Andrea (2); Pascarelli, L. Andrea (2); Mornati, Susanna (2); Shearer, Kathleen (3); Lasou, Pierre (4)</em><br><em>1: Queen’s University Library, Canada; 2: 4Science, Italy; 3: COAR; 4: Université Laval</em><br>Members of the Canadian Association of Research Libraries’ Open Repositories Working Group (CARL-ORWG) have a common goal of making research outcomes generated at their universities openly available to the global knowledge commons. In 2018 a subset of CARL-ORWG led by Queen’s University pooled their resources and hired 4Science to develop code to make aggregation from DSpace current versions (5 &amp; 6) into OpenAire possible. In discussions with 4Science it was proposed and decided that this development work include a patch for adding ORCIDs to the required OAI-PMH feed. This presentation will provide background on this completed work including the principles and goals for open research shared by CARL members and 4Science and the details of the ORCID patch. DSpace is the most popular open source repository platform in the world and this implementation will bring benefit to the vast global community using the latest versions of DSpace, besides providing guidance and inspiration to other communities.</p>
<p><strong>How to ensure “good” data? Quality assurance by research data repositories</strong><br><em>Kindling, Maxi; Strecker, Dorothea; Petras, Vivien; Wang, Yi</em><br><em>Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Berlin School of Library and Information Science,Germany</em><br>Data quality is of high interest to all stakeholder groups in research data sharing. Nevertheless, data quality assurance by research data repositories is a little explored field. This contribution examines the role of research data repositories in data quality assurance based on a mixed-methods study carried out by the project re3data COREF. The main focus is on the presentation of the results of a survey among repository operators and a framework for data quality assurance by research data repositories.</p>

For a Version of Record this will typically be supplied by the publisher (most often in the form of a DOI). In this presentation we will discuss the technical and policy considerations of how to add persistent identifiers to Author Accepted Manuscripts. This ensures that they are also fully available for discovery and citation to participate as first order participants in the open research ecosystem</p>
<p><strong>Experience in Moving Toward An Open Repository For All</strong><br><em>Chuang, Tyng-Ruey (1); Lee, Cheng-Jen (1); Wang, Chia-Hsun (1); Wang, Yu-Huang (2)</em><br><em>1: Academia Sinica, Taiwan; 2: Independent Scholar</em><br>We report on our experience in building a domain-specific research data repository and in moving it toward an open repository for all to deposit datasets.</p>
<p><strong>Plan S and Open Access via repositories: Unity in diversity</strong><br><em>Rooryck, Johan (1); Rumsey, Sally (2)</em><br><em>1: Leiden University, cOAlition S; 2: Jisc, cOAlition S</em><br>cOAlition S comprises research funding organizations that have agreed to adopt the set of principles that form Plan S. As autonomous entities, when aligning their policies to Plan S, each may differ in detail of how it is implemented. Each funder is at liberty to express a preference for one route to Open Access over another, and individual funders may have differing preferences for deposit in a repository. cOAlition S encourages a range of solutions towards Open Access that encourage innovation, allow for geographical, financial, &amp; cultural preferences &amp; differences, and that can influence the broader open access scholarly landscape. cOAlition S encourages diversity in business models to achieve OA, recognizes journal and repository routes to OA, and accepts community norms rather than specifying technical standards for repositories. It has also taken steps to ensure researcher choice of publication venue by adopting its Rights Retention Strategy, enabling a means to publish in any journal using the repository option (thereby encouraging diversity of journals), whilst meeting funder OA requirements. This presentation will illuminate how diversity in OA solutions, supported and encouraged by cOAlition S, is brought together under a single unified aim – immediate OA with an open licence.</p>

Seeking seamless depositing solutions for multi (LMIC) country qualitative data</strong><br><em>Choudhury, Moni (1); Salim, Hani (1,2); Mahmood, Hana (3); Agarwal, Dhiraj (4); Bhattacharjee, Tathagata (4,5); Norrie, John (1); Juvekar, Sanjay (4)</em><br><em>1: University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom; 2: Universiti Putra Malaysia, Malaysia; 3: Neoventive Solutions, Pakistan; 4: KEMHRC, Pune, India; 5: LSHTM, United Kingdom</em><br>NIHR-RESPIRE collaboration spans across four South Asian, low-middle income countries (LMICs) of Bangladesh, India, Malaysia and Pakistan, and hosted by the University of Edinburgh. One of the deliverables of RESPIRE is to deposit and share research data in an open-source repository. We explored if all RESPIRE data could be deposited into one open repository. Our methodology was organic but included: retrospective review of all RESPIRE projects’ proposals and/or protocols; remote and face-to-face discussions with the RESPIRE research project teams about data management, and ready-made data depositing solutions including repositories at the University of Edinburgh. We piloted both quantitative and qualitative data submissions into a preferred open repository: Edinburgh DataShare. Quantitative data is relatively straightforward in being de-identified and can be made available in open repositories, but qualitative data is more challenging. The data from a RESPIRE PhD project highlighted that raw qualitative data could not be deposited openly due to the sensitive nature of the data and current lack of guidance on de-identification of raw data such as images. Other raw data include original audio recordings, verbatim and translated transcripts. Similarly, discussions at the RESPIRE annual scientific meeting highlighted that qualitative data presented this challenge across all RESPIRE partners.</p>
<p><strong>Interoperability as a service</strong><br><em>Burland, Tamsin Margaret; Kaye, John; Stokes, Paul; Williams, Howard</em><br><em>Jisc, United Kingdom</em><br>As the use of digital research systems technology continues to grow and evolve, Research Organisations are increasingly struggling with issues of systems incompatibility and manual re-keying of information. As part of its work to build an integrated repository and digital preservation service, Jisc has built an open interoperability framework based on an open and extensible data model and open API. This framework already supports integrated workflows among a number of repositories, commercial CRISs and digital preservation services. In this talk, we will discuss how this framework could be offered as a service to institutions to provide workflow integration with other research systems, including those used to manage research grants and contracts, ethics, research impact and web content.</p>
<p><strong>Would auto-translation of metadata enhance discovery and impact of research data?</strong><br><em>Stokes, Paul L. S.; Burland, Tamsin; Kaye, John; Williams, Howard</em><br><em>Jisc, United Kingdom</em><br>It’s widely accepted that good quality metadata is a significant factor in discovery and reuse of digital objects. Because of the way data standards and infrastructure has evolved, much of the metadata currently in circulation is either in English and/or based upon standards formulated in English. This reduces discovery, impact (and potentially reuse) in areas of the world where English is not widely spoken. The converse is also true when it comes to the impact of non-English digital objects and metadata on the English-speaking world. There are many auto-translation tools available that lend themselves fairly well to the translation of words and short passages of text… such as keywords/phrases and abstracts. This presentation explores the potential (and difficulties associated with) the incorporation of such tools in deposit and preservation workflows.</p>
<p><strong>Lessons learnt in setting up a &#8220;one person repository&#8221;</strong><br><em>Murugesan, Ravi</em><br><em>Auroville, India</em><br>Librarians in the developing world often work in resource-constrained contexts without substantial IT support, yet they may be tasked with implementing institutional repositories. Mature open source applications do exist for this purpose &#8211; notably EPrints and DSpace &#8211; so the issue is not about developing a repository from scratch. Instead it is about selecting a suitable open source application, understanding what costs are involved, carrying out (or supervising) the installation, and of course, depositing items. In 2019, I began to do this work for my institution in south India. I used EPrints to set up a repository that is hosted on a competitively priced cloud server (on a plan that costs less than 4 US Dollars per month). I carried out the installation by myself and I am also the only person in charge of adding items to the repository. My experience leads me to believe that a one person repository (inspired by the concept of one person library) is indeed possible on a small scale. I hope to convince librarians that they can describe and minimize the IT support and funds they need if they are looking to get started with an institutional repository.</p>
<p><strong>Pavia Digital Library: enhancing and supporting interoperability within the Cultural Heritage Domain with DSpace-GLAM</strong><br><em>Rossini, Gabriele (2); Nassi, Paolo (2); Canevari, Roberto (2); Aurelio, Massimo (2); Cortese, Claudio (1); Groppo, Emilia (1); Bollini, Andrea (1); Fazio, Riccardo (1); Perelli, Matteo (1); Scognamiglio, Francesco Pio (1)</em><br><em>1: 4Science, Italy; 2: Università degli Studi di Pavia, Italy</em><br>The digital cultural heritage of the University of Pavia is characterized by its size and variety: archival materials, ancient books, museum objects and documents related to the history and activity of the University make up one of the most important heritage for the study of Italian modern and contemporaneous literature and history. Until now, these materials could not be explored in an integrated way within a Digital Library. The differences in data models and metadata standards adopted made it impossible to guarantee interoperability between the different cultural resources. These problems have now been overcome through the use of DSpace-GLAM, an extension of DSpace specifically structured for cultural heritage management. The presentation starting from Pavia University case study will illustrate how, after mapping different data structures on DSpace-GLAM flexible data model, it is possible not only to navigate through the pages of the various documents, but also to study the historical and geographical context of the digital objects, exploring people, events and places related to them; therefore, moving the application from a Digital Library to a Digital Humanities Platform.</p>
<p><strong>Breaking language barriers</strong><br><em>Luyten, Bram</em><br><em>Atmire, Belgium</em><br>Early localization support has been a factor in the global uptake of the DSpace repository platform. As great as it is to see regional communities really make DSpace their own, it makes it very clear that support for specific localization use cases still needs to be added to the core DSpace platform. This presentation will highlight localization improvements and multi-language support, both in the core DSpace 7 platform, as well as in Atmire&#8217;s Open Repository implementation of DSpace 7.</p>
<p><strong>A National PID Landscape and Beyond</strong><br><em>Vials Moore, Adam (1); Duke, Monica (1); Notay, Balviar (1); Brown, Christopher (1); Meadows, Alice (2); Brown, Josh (2)</em><br><em>1: Jisc, United Kingdom; 2: MoreBrains Cooperative</em><br>The information landscape for infrastructure that captures and exposes scholarly communications and the associated individuals, organisations and connected entities has developed over the last several years.

<p><strong>DSpace-CRIS 7 is here!</strong><br><em>Bollini, Andrea; Boychuk, Mykhaylo; Cavallo, Pasquale; Cortese, Claudio; Digilio, Giuseppe; Fazio, Riccardo; Fiorenza, Damiano; Giamminonni, Luca; Lombardi, Corrado; Martelli, Alessandro; Pascarelli, Luigi Andrea; Perelli, Matteo; Scognamiglio, Francesco Pio; Mornati, Susanna</em><br><em>4Science, Italy</em><br>Open Repository 2021 will sign the momentum of the DSpace and DSpace-CRIS 7 release. This presentation will demonstrate the key features of DSpace-CRIS explaining how it differs from a plain DSpace in providing a full fledged open source CRIS system promoting open science. Indeed, other than allowing to record data about any kind of entities and their relation DSpace-CRIS focus on end-to-end functionalities to support business processes and expectations such as &#8211; the self management of researcher profiles with a full bidirectional ORCID integration; &#8211; project, funding and awards management providing the ability to track and organize them over time adding more details and information when needed; &#8211; simplify the administration, improve the data quality and reduce the administrative burden; &#8211; extended interoperability supporting the most richer exchange formats such as OpenAIRE CERIF. DSpace-CRIS 7 is a production-grade, ready-to-use, CRIS solution under real usage and data load, with early adopters also at National scale. The DSpace-CRIS 7 is not just a revamp of the features already available in previous versions but taking the opportunities offered by the new modern architecture provides completely new features and integrations. Migration path from previous versions will be discussed.</p>
<p><strong>DSpace 7 &#8211; Enhanced Submission &amp; Workflow</strong><br><em>Bollini, Andrea; Digilio, Giuseppe; Cortese, Claudio</em><br><em>4Science, Italy</em><br>After more than 4 years of development, thousands of commits and hours spent in developing the new version DSpace 7 is finally close to being released and expected to be presented at Open Repository. One of the core components [1] of DSpace is the submission and workflow process that was largely redesigned and improved in the new version. The presentation will provide a deep dive into the new Enhanced Submission and Workflow features of DSpace 7, including how to configure, customize &amp; use this feature (and differences with DSpace 6 and below) showing how to take advantage of the offered flexibility taking examples from customization and extensions developed by early adopter projects. This presentation is a renewed version of a similar presentation held at OR2019 [2] updated to reflect the final status of the features for DSpace 7, include details about the transition from the Bibliographic Transformation Engine (BTE) [3] used in previous DSpace version to an updated Live Import Framework [4] and inspirational examples from running projects.</p>
<p><strong>DSpace 7 &#8211; Configurable Entities</strong><br><em>Droogmans, Lieven; Bosman, Ben</em><br><em>Atmire, Belgium</em><br>DSpace 7 has been extended with the possibility of “Configurable Entities” in response to a growing need for describing more types of objects and relations between objects as well as compound objects. Examples include: authors, projects, datasets, grants, monographs, lecture series, … . The new Configurable Entities feature and new concepts in DSpace 7 will be presented such as relations between items, virtual metadata, … . Defining an entity model through configuration is made possible without using Java classes for the specific entities. To achieve this, the concept starts from the current DSpace Item object and extends it, allowing institutions to keep using DSpace with standard items. The entities in a custom entity model are items that can be typed, and relations between items of different types can be created. Several entity models can be defined and can exist alongside one another in one repository. Finally, this talk will briefly touch on the next steps for future versions of DSpace. This presentation is an update to the presentation “DSpace 7 &#8211; The Power of Configurable Entities” presented at OR2019 as the work has now been finalized and the features announced at OR2019 have now been implemented and can be demonstrated.</p>

This panel will discuss strategies for meeting certification standards for Trustworthy Data Repositories (TDR) across a variety of repositories with different methods of appraisal, curation, preservation, and organization. The audience will be encouraged to add to the discussion and invited to provide feedback on the concepts presented by the panelists.</p>

<p><strong>Open for all. Reusable for whom? A review of what data reusers want and how data repositories can deliver</strong><br><em>Johnston, Lisa R (1); Faniel, Ixchel M (2); Wissel, Katie (3)</em><br><em>1: University of Minnesota, United States of America; 2: OCLC Research, United States of America; 3: New York University</em><br>Understanding how data reusers seek and evaluate potential data for reuse will aid data curators, data managers, and developers in the open repository field. We will review past studies of data reusers, specifically a qualitative study of 105 researchers from three disciplinary communities: quantitative social science, archaeology, and zoology. The study identified 12 types of context information that data reusers mention needing when deciding whether to reuse data. Next, we will use the context types to create a feature set and assess how data repositories provide the needed context information to users. Finally, using findings from our assessment, we will showcase desirable features in use to prototype the design of a reuser-oriented data repository that developers can use to improve their data repository interface.</p>
<p><strong>Open for all but for how long? Roles, responsibilities and accountabilities in the preservation of research data</strong><br><em>Currie, Amy; Kilbride, William</em><br><em>Digital Preservation Coalition, United Kingdom</em><br>In the open science community, digital preservation aligns closely to the FAIR principles and is delivered, albeit unevenly, through infrastructures comprising technology (i.e., repositories), know how (i.e., staff) and ‘know why’ (such as policy). In line with conference sub-theme of ‘Supporting open scholarship and cultural heritage’, this presentation will explore and describe the strengths and weaknesses of the open science community at the outset of the EOSC Association. It draws from the recent ‘FAIR Forever’ study commissioned by the EOSC Sustainability Working Group and funded by the EOSC Secretariat to establish the strengths and weakness of digital preservation capability in open science in Europe. The FAIR Forever study involved three stages of research: a desk-based assessment of the EOSC vision, interviews with representatives of EOSC stakeholders, and focus groups comprised of digital preservation specialists and data managers in research repositories. This presentation will explore and describe the study’s key findings relating to digital preservation capacity within EOSC and for the research community more broadly. The presenters will make recommendations for coordinated actions by repositories, researchers, and stakeholders to better ensure the long-term preservation of—and access to—research data in all its forms.</p>
<p><strong>The Entity-Relation Metamodel from Repositories to Aggregators &#8211; The case of LA Referencia and RCAAP jointship Project</strong><br><em>Carvalho, José (1); Matas, Lautaro (2); Segundo, Washington (3); Graça, Paulo (4); Lopes, Paulo (4)</em><br><em>1: University of Minho, Portugal; 2: LA Referencia; 3: IBICT; 4: FCT|FCCN</em><br>This proposal demonstrates the work developed at the harvester level in order to incorporate the concept of entities coming from repositories. To achieve this, technical interoperability and guidelines have been implemented and also guarantee the coexistence of repositories with and without entities, as well as different types of aggregation processes and different metadata profiles. The objective of these developments is to support a complete representation of the repository data model at the harvester level and to provide added value services for all harvested content based on an open infrastructure.</p>
